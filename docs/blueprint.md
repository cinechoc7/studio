# **App Name**: Colis Suivi Pro

## Core Features:

- Tracking Input: Allow users to enter a tracking code to view package status.
- Package Status Display: Display current status and location of the package based on tracking data.
- Admin Dashboard: Provide an admin interface to manually update package status and location.
- Status Updates: Enable admins to select from predefined status updates (e.g., 'en cours d'emballage,' 'en cours de transit').
- Delivery Notification: Notify the customer (via email or SMS) when the package arrives at its destination.
- Route Optimization Tool: Leverage AI to suggest the fastest and most efficient delivery route, dynamically adjusting based on real-time traffic and weather conditions; the LLM should incorporate up-to-the-minute conditions when generating an ideal delivery plan. Admins have the option to override the route plan, of course.
- Mobile-First Design: Ensure the user interface is responsive and functions seamlessly as a native app on mobile devices.
