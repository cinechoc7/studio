/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Package Tracking Application
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes a secure admin experience while allowing for public tracking.
 * Administrative actions are restricted to authenticated users, while public package
 * information is readable by anyone who has the specific package ID.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /packages/{packageId}: Stores public package information. Each document is a parcel.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access for Tracking: A single package document (`get`) is publicly readable
 *   to facilitate easy tracking without authentication.
 * - Admin-Only Management: Creating, updating, deleting, and listing packages (`list`, `write`)
 *   is restricted to authenticated admin users.
