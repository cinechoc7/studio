/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Package Tracking Application
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes a secure admin experience. All data access is restricted
 * to authenticated users. Public tracking is handled by a read-only JSON cache,
 * not by direct Firestore access from unauthenticated clients.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /packages/{packageId}: Stores package information. Each document is a parcel.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin-Only Access: All read and write operations on the entire database are
 *   restricted to authenticated admin users. This simplifies security and ensures
 *   that only trusted users can modify or view data directly from the database.
